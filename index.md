## **Research History**

**IceCube research [2020 -]**: (to be updated)

**Supernova relic neutrino search in Super-Kamiokande [2019 -]**: (to be updated)

**Neutrino neutral-current quasielastic scattering measurement in T2K [2018 - 2019]**: Neutrino-oxygen neutral-current quasielastic interactions are among the major background in supernova relic neutrino searches at water Cherenkov detectors. I was analysing Super-Kamipkande data from T2K beams to measure this channel precisely, utilizing nuclear γ-rays as a signal mode. The results serve the world most precise measurement for both neutrino and antineutrino cross sections of this channel. Especially the result for antineutrinos is the first experimental measurement ever. The analysis results are published in a paper ([link](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.100.112009)). 

**Super-Kamiokande refurbishment work [2018]**: I was joining the Super-Kamokande detector refurbishment work, which was for the later Gd loading. I was dedicated to especially the outer detector work, including replacement of old PMTs and shading sheets, rust removal, etc. The photos can be found in the Super-Kamiokande official website ([link](http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sk/tankopen2018/photo-e.html); *a smiling guy in No.27 is me!*). 

**T2K muon beam monitor studies [2016 - 2019]**: I was working as an expert of the muon monitor for T2K. Here I managed the calibration and trouble shootings in the experimental operation and performed various studies for the current and future beam monitors. We investigated the issues with the current detectors, silicon sensors and ion chambers, and confirmed their responses to the beam power. As a new candidate for the future detector, replacing with the current ones, we proposed electron-multiplier tubes (EMTs) and tested with the prototype sensors. The results are published in a paper ([link](https://academic.oup.com/ptep/article/2018/10/103H01/5145636)). 

**Measurement of γ-rays from neutron-oxygen reactions [2015 - 2020]**: We conducted beam tests at Osaka University’s Research Center for Nuclear Physics (RCNP) to measure production cross sections of γ-rays arising from the neutron-oxygen reaction. This is motivated by the large systematic uncertainty regarding the relevant cross sections in the neutrino neutral-current measurement in T2K. The measurement results are sumarrized in a paper ([link](http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08964)). As a necessary technique to estimate the neutron background in the γ-ray spectroscopy we investigated a CsI(Tl) scintillator capability of the pulse shape discrimination ([link](https://academic.oup.com/ptep/article/2018/4/043H01/4980960)).

**Beam intensity scan with ATLAS pixel detectors [2015]**: As a research project in the CERN summer student program, I was working on the beam intensity measurement in the LHC-ATLAS experiment. The beam intensity is measured by the van der Meer scan in the collider experiment, where the Gaussian shape is assumed for the beam profile. I studied the potential systematic uncertainty coming from this assumption by changing the beam shape in a toy MC simulation. I also analysed the vdM scan data observed by the IBL detector and measured the beam intensity roughly. 

**Cosmological parameter impacts on CMB B-Modes [2014]**: As a research theme for the undergraduate thesis, I was studying the impact of cosmological parameters on the CMB B-mode using the CAMB simulator.
